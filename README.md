## Introduction
Welcome to the assignment repository where you will find an exciting web portal project. In this assignment, you will embark on a journey to build a powerful web application with a robust Node.js backend and a dynamic frontend using Angular (our preferred choice) or the JavaScript framework of your choice. The mission: Create a portal for seamlessly performing CRUD operations on a CSV-formatted file securely stored in the backend server's local storage.

## Assignment Requirements
1. **Backend Superpowers:** The backend part of this assignment is powered by Node.js, giving you a solid foundation to work your magic.
2. **Frontend Flexibility:** While the backend is set in Node.js, you have the creative freedom to choose the frontend JavaScript framework. Angular is the star of the show, but you are free to express your style.
3. **Data Manipulation:** The portal's primary role is to let users perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a CSV-formatted file, offering data management at your fingertips.
4. **CSV Adventures:** As the mastermind behind this project, you have the liberty to curate the content of the CSV file. But remember, it must have at least five columns to keep things interesting.
5. **RESTful Realm:** Your Node.js backend must provide a suite of REST-based APIs, making it easy for your frontend to interact with the data.
6. **Coding Wizardry:** The assignment calls for industry-standard coding practices and design patterns. Let your code reflect the elegance of a seasoned developer.
7. **Test Crusader:** The backend code is more than just lines of code; it's a fortress of resilience. It must be fortified with unit tests, and we demand a pass rate of over 80%.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to kickstart your journey with this captivating project:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system.
- If you opt for Angular on the frontend, don your developer's cape and install the Angular CLI.

### Installation
1. Begin your adventure by cloning this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory, and let the journey begin.

### Backend Mastery
1. Venture into the `backend` directory, where the backend enchantment awaits.
2. Fuel your backend prowess by installing the necessary dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Now, with a wave of your command, summon the Node.js server: `npm start`.

### Frontend Magic (Angular - Example)
1. If Angular is your wand of choice, proceed to the `frontend` directory.
2. Invoke the spirits of Angular with an incantation: `npm install` to gather the necessary components.
3. With the power of the Angular CLI, conjure the Angular development server: `ng serve`.

## Usage
Once your backend and frontend enchantments are ready, you can unlock the portal's gate by visiting the specified URL http://localhost:4200. The CSV file, with its captivating data, will be at your command.
